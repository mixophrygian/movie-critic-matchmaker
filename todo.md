Have swipable navigation! And also random array index shuffler. NExt step is to push these indices into a global store and test out with the \_posts.js file - can your swipe navigation traverse the shuffled array of indices retaining the correct order? Set up global state so you can keep track of:

-array of movie indices to use
-user ratings
-current movie index

**_ consider updating UI to have a list of swipable cards - https://github.com/simonepm/likecarousel/blob/master/index.html _**

Looks much more tinder-like. Could generate random indices to build card pile.

did it!

next: figure out how to fetch movies and obscure apikey? Maybe on the server?
